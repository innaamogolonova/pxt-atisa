    pins.D0.digitalWrite(false)
})
```

## Example Step 3 @fullscreen

Explicit tutorial check in step. Like "Do you see the light turn on on the simulator?"

## Example Step 4 @fullscreen

Add another `||blocks:pause||` and `||pins:digital write||` to create a blinking effect.
Click [this video](https://youtu.be/qqBmvHD5bCw).

```blocks
forever(function() {
    pins.D0.digitalWrite(false)
    pause(500)
    pins.D0.digitalWrite(true)
    pause(500)
})
```

Play with the duration in your pauses to create different patterns.
